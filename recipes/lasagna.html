        <h2>The Best Homemade Lasagna</h2>
        <p>
            This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.
            <br> 
            Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly!
            </br> 
            This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.
        </p>

            <li>
                1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)

            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Put pasta water on to boil:</strong>
            <br>
                Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat.
                <br>
                It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.
                </br>
            </br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Brown the ground beef:</strong>
            <br>
                In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
                <br>
                Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.
                </br>
            </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:</strong>
            <br>
                Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
                </br>
                Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened.
                Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
                <br> 
                Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.
                </br>
            </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Make the sauce:</strong>
            <br>
                Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.
                <br>
                Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.
                </br>
                Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.
                Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. 
                <br>
                Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. 
                </br>
                Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.
                <br>
                Remove from heat.
                </br>
            </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</strong>
            <br>
                By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling.
                <br> 
                Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions.
                </br> 
                (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.) Stir often to prevent from sticking.
                <br> 
                Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.
                </br>
                When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.
                <br>
                Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet,
                </br> 
                turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil.
                <br>
                This will prevent them from sticking together.
                </br>
            </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</strong>
                <br></br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong>
            <br>
                In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish.
                <br> 
                Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce.
                </br> 
                Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.
                Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce.
                <br> 
                Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple of inches.
                </br> 
                Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.
                <br>
                Apply the second layer of noodles and top it with half of the remaining sauce. 
                </br>
                Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.
                <br>
                Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
                </br>
            </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Bake:</strong>
                <br>
                (Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce).
                <br> 
                Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Cool and serve:</strong>
                <br>
                Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days.
                <br> 
                You can reheat it in a conventional oven or microwave. Leave the aluminum tent on for storage.
                </br> 
                (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
                </br>
            </li>
        </ol>
