        <h4>Orange Cream Popsicles</h4>

        <p>The 4-ingredient summer treat we long for.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <h4>For the meat sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup (170g) orange juice concentrate, thawed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (340g) plain whole milk yogurt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Method</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Whisk the ingredients:</strong>
                <br>
                Whisk the orange concentrate and sugar in a large bowl (spouted, if you have one) that can hold 3 cups of liquid.
                <br> 
                Whisk in yogurt and milk until smooth.
                </br> 
                The mixture will be thick like a bottled smoothie or thick pulp-filled juice.
               </br>
               </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the popsicles:</strong>
                <br>
                If you don't have a spouted bowl, pour the ice pop mixture into a large glass measuring cup.
                <br> 
                Pour the yogurt mixture up to the fill line of your popsicle mold or within 1/4 inch of the top of an alternative container (such as a small paper cup).
                </br>  
                Add the sticks to the popsicle mold and move to the freezer. 
                </br>
                If using an alternative container, cover with plastic wrap and cut a slit in the center and slip the stick through the slit.
                <br> 
                This will keep the stick in place as well as keep the popsicle covered.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Freeze:</strong>
                <br>
                Transfer the popsicles to the freezer.
                <br> 
                Straighten the sticks for alternative containers (if using) after moving to the freezer and freeze undisturbed for 8 hours.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Unmold and serve:</strong>
                <br>
                Once frozen, follow the manufacturer's instructions for removing the popsicles from the mold.
                <br> 
                I found that setting the popsicles in a cup filled with warm water for 1 minute made removal a breeze.
                </br> 
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Storage:</strong>
                <br>
                Keep leftover popsicles in an airtight freezer bag for up to 2 months.
                </br>
            </li>
        </ol>
