        <h4>Method</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F</strong>
                <br></br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong>
                <br>
                Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk until there are no egg whites visible and it begins to look a little frothy. 
                <br>
                Set aside.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Cook the vegetables:</strong>
                <br>
                Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a cast-iron pan over medium heat.
                <br> 
                Add the bell peppers, scallions, and tomatoes.
                </br> 
                Cook, until the peppers become brighter in color and the scallions become slightly softened, 
                1 to 2 minutes.
                </br>
                Add the spinach to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until it has wilted, about 1 minute.
                <br> 
                Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the frittata:</strong>
                <br>
                Pour the whisked eggs into the pan over the vegetables.
                <br> 
                Layer the plantains over the eggs in a circular pattern until the pan is entirely filled.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Drizzle with olive oil:</strong>
                <br>
                Drizzle the remaining olive oil (about a teaspoon), over the top of the plantains.
                <br> 
                Season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
                </br> 
                Garnish with chopped fresh rosemary.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Bake the frittata:</strong>
                <br>
                Bake frittata for 15 minutes.
                <br> 
                Once its fully cooked, you will notice that the frittata will have risen, 
                the plantains will be golden brown and slightly crispy.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Serve:</strong>
                <br>
                Cut the frittata into quarters and serve 2 quarters per person.
                <br> 
                Sprinkle a pinch of chili flakes (optional) and serve alongside your favorite salad.
                </br>
                </br>
            </li>
        </ol>
